# Unofficial Minetest API documentation

This github repo contains the source files for the website.<br/>
Feel free to make a pull request, not on the `gh-pages` branch though.

# Editing the site
To add a new page, just create a new file in the `docs/` directory and give it an appropriate name.

You are not required to install MkDocs just to edit the source files, but you will need it to preview the changes.

To preview the changes you've made to the source files, open up a terminal in the repo's main directory and run `mkdocs serve` and navigate to `localhost:8000` on your browser.

# Making a Pull Request.
Once you're done editing the source files, you can make a pull request. Please note that the site on the `gh-pages` branch is required to be manually built. This means that you will have to wait a bit until I have the time to build it.
