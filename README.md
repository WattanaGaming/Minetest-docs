# Unofficial Minetest API documentation

This github repo contains the source files for the website.<br/>
Feel free to make a pull request, not on the gh-pages branch though.

# Editing the site
To add a new page, just create a new file in the `docs/` directory and give it an appropriate name.

You are not required to install MkDocs just to edit the source files, but you will need it to preview the changes.

To preview the changes you've made to the source files, open up a terminal in the repo's main directory and run `mkdocs serve` and navigate to `localhost:8000` on your browser.
