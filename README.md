# Unofficial Minetest API documentation

This github repo contains the source files for the site and the site HTML files.<br/>
Feel free to make a pull request.

# Editing the site
To add a new page, just create a new file in the `docs/` directory and give it an appropriate name.<br/>

You are not required to install MkDocs just to edit the source files, but you will need it to preview the changes.<br/>
To preview the changes you've made to the source files, open up a terminal in the repo's main directory and run `mkdocs serve` and navigate to `localhost:8000` on your browser.

# Building the site
Before we begin, please note that this step requires MkDocs.

After you're done editing the source files and feel like they're ready to be published, open up a terminal in the repo's main directory and run `mkdocs build`.
