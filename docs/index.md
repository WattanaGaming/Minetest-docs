This website was made with the goal of being a solid documentation for Minetest and it's modding API. If you find something to be missing from the documentation, feel free to make a pull request on this website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WattanaGaming/Minetest-docs)

## What are mods?
In Minetest, contents and features can be added using Lua scripts in a runtine-loaded mod; a self-contained bunch of scripts, textures and other related files, which is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest.

Mods are contained and ran solely on the server side. Definitions and media files are automatically transferred to the client.
