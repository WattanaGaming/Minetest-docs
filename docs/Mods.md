# Mods
Since Minetest by itself is just an engine, most if not all gameplay functionalities have to me implemented in mods.

A mod is a self-contained collection of scripts, textures and other related files, which is loaded by and interfaces with Minetest. They are contained and ran solely on the server side file definitions and media files are automatically transferred to the client.
